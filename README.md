# webPythonArduino
Hello,

With this code you will be able to easely get data from and Arduino and display it on a webpage using Webpy.
The code should be self explainatory it you already have basic Python knowledge. If you got any questions I will be happy to answer, just contact me!

What you will need to make the code work:
  - Python
  - Webpy
  - Linux
  - Network Connection
  - Arduino

I plan adding a detailed tutorial soon.

Here is an example of a school project using the code: https://github.com/prototypenguin/SolarTracker
